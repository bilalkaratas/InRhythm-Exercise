To reduce code duplication and to avoid complex coding, 4 methods are created.
1) getCleanedList(String sentence) method will remove the digits and special characters
from the String and will return us a List of Strings
2) lengthOfLongestWord(String sentence) method will return the length of the longest word in a sentence.
3) longestWords(String sentence) method will return us a list of the longest words in a string.
4) showLongestWords(String sentence) method is used as per requirements to display the longest word(s) and length

        Unit test is executed based on 3 different situations.
        - The given (regular) string
        - A string with multiple longest words
        - A string with many special chars and digits
